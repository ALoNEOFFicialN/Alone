## Can I self-host Quotient?

We would rather prefer you not running a direct cloned instance of Quotient. It would be a ton better to just [`Invite`](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=746348747918934096&permissions=21175985838&redirect_uri=https://discord.gg/aBM5xz6&response_type=code&scope=bot) the bot.The source here is only for educational purpose and to maintain transparency on how we collect, use your data and off-course on how Quotient's primary features work. We also do not take any responsibility if the code malfunctions on your side.

If you decide to edit, compile or use this code in any way. Kindly respect the [`LICENSE`](https://github.com/quotientbot/Quotient-Bot/blob/main/LICENSE).

## How do I contribute?

If you are looking forward to contribute to the project, we welcome you with open arms. kindly open an issue first for discussion.
It's also a good option to join the [`Support Server`](https://discord.gg/aBM5xz6) and get into touch with anyone having @team role.

There are also some easter eggs in the code, let's see if you can find some :wink:
