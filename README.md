## Running

I would prefer if you don't run an instance of Quotient. You can directly invite it from the above given URL. The source here is provided for educational purposes only.

If you still want to run Quotient on your machine, here are the steps you want to do:

1. Make sure you have [Python 3.8](https://www.python.org/) or higher.
2. Setup Environment. (We used [`poetry`](https://pypi.org/project/poetry/))
3. Setup [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) database
4. Setup [Tortoise-ORM](https://github.com/tortoise/tortoise-orm)
5. Rename example_config.py to config.py and fill in all the secrets
6. Run `./src/bot.py`
